# Collaborative To-Do List Application

## Overview
Implementation of a collaborative to-do list application in Java and JavaScript demonstrating language-specific features.

## Requirements Met
- ✅ Data storage for tasks and user-specific views
- ✅ Task categorization and status tracking  
- ✅ Support for concurrency (multiple users accessing/editing tasks)
- ✅ Java: Classes, OOP principles, and threads
- ✅ JavaScript: async/await and JSON storage

## Running the Applications

### Java Version (Interactive)
```bash
cd java
javac TodoApp.java
java TodoApp
```
Then follow the menu prompts to:
- Create tasks
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks complete
- View tasks
- Run concurrency demo

### JavaScript Version (Interactive)
```bash
cd javascript
node todoApp.js
```
Then follow the menu prompts to:
- Create tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks complete
- View tasks
- Run concurrency demo

## Language Features Demonstrated

### Java
- **Classes**: User, Task, TodoService classes
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, data hiding
- **Concurrency**: Threads with ExecutorService

### JavaScript  
- **Async/Await**: Promise-based concurrent operations
- **JSON**: Native JSON serialization for data storage
- **Classes**: ES6 class syntax
