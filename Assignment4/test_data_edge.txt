# Test Data: Alternative Scenario (6 employees - shows partial success)
# Use this data when running the interactive Java/Python programs

# For Java: Enter these numbers when prompted
# 6 (number of employees)
# Then enter employee names: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Frank
# Then for each employee, enter preferences (1=Morning, 2=Afternoon, 3=Evening, 0=None):
# Alice: 1,2,3,0,0,0,0
# Bob: 2,3,1,0,0,0,0
# Charlie: 3,1,2,0,0,0,0
# David: 1,2,3,0,0,0,0
# Eve: 2,3,1,0,0,0,0
# Frank: 3,1,2,0,0,0,0

# For Python: Enter these when prompted
# 6 (number of employees)
# Then enter employee names: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Frank
# Then enter preferences: Alice, Monday, Morning, Bob, Monday, Afternoon, etc.

# Expected Result: Should work for some days but show warnings for others
# Available: 6 employees × 5 days max = 30 employee-shifts
# Minimum needed: 2 employees per shift × 3 shifts × 7 days = 42 employee-shifts
